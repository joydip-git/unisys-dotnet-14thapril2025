data abstraction		
implementation abstraction
object abstraction

Type => abstract

every class has two extra hidden data members => top (type object pointer) and sbi (sync block index)

Class empClsType = Employee.class

Reflection: abput metadata of types. Relies on metadata to do other things.
	1. load assembly dynamically
	2. Runtime Type Discovery
	3. create instance dynamically (on the fly)
	3. invoke members of an instance dynamically (on the fly, such as methods, properties etc.)

Inheritance:
class A
{
	private string name;
	private string location;
	private string salary;

	public A(){}

	public A(string name, string location, string salary)
	{
		this.name = name;
		this.location = location;
		this.salary = salary;
	}
}
class B:A
{
	string someData;

	public B(){}

	public B(string name, string location, string salary, string someData)
	{		
		this.someData = someData;
	}
}


B obj = new B();
